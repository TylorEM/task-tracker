# Task Tracker App

The main goal of creating this application is to familiarize myself with the workings of the React Library. This will be used as my reference point project for the rest of my react projects, so useful comments will be added.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
